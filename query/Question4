--Question: Which sale staff processed the most orders ?--
--Step1: Define order processed monthly by each staffs--
WITH staff_order_count AS (
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) AS year1, --extract year from order date/order is placed on what year-- 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS month1, -- extract month from order date/order is placed on what month--
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count, -- number of order are placed--
        s.first_name -- staff's name--
FROM orders AS o
    INNER JOIN staffs as s --joining 2 tables (staffs&orders)--
    ON o.staff_id = s.staff_id --using staff id to join 2 tables--
    GROUP BY month1, s.first_name, year1
    ORDER BY year1 ),

--Step2: Define what is the max order processed for monthly basis--
max_order AS (
SELECT  year1, 
        month1, 
        MAX(order_count) AS max_count --highest number of orders placed by staffs--
    FROM staff_order_count
    GROUP BY year1, month1)

--Step3: Define sale staff who processed orders the most in every month--
SELECT 
    s1.year1 AS year2,
    s1.month1 AS month2,
    s1.first_name,
    s1.order_count
FROM staff_order_count AS s1
INNER JOIN max_order m 
  ON s1.year1 = m.year1 
 AND s1.month1 = m.month1 
 AND s1.order_count = m.max_count --matching number of orders placed to find top sale staff--
ORDER BY year2, month2;
