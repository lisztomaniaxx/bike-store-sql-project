--Question: Which product contributed revenue the most in each month?--
--Step1: Define total revenue in each month by product--
WITH revenue AS (
SELECT 
    pd.product_name,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) AS sale_year, --order is placed on what year--
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS sale_month, --order is placed on what month--
    SUM(oi.list_price * oi.quantity * (1 - oi.discount)) AS total_revenue --sum total revenue--
FROM orders AS o 
JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products AS pd ON oi.product_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY sale_year, sale_month, pd.product_name -- grouping into product name, year, month--
ORDER BY sale_year),

--Step2: Rank product by amount of revenue generated--
ranking AS (
SELECT
    *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sale_year,sale_month ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS product_rank --getting rank of product sold in each month and year by product with highest revenue will be ranked first--
FROM revenue)

--Step3: define top product in each month and year--
SELECT
    sale_year, sale_month, product_name, total_revenue,
    CASE --identify popularity of product--
        WHEN product_rank = 1 THEN 'BEST SELLER' --highest rank will be described as best seller--
        WHEN product_rank = 2 OR product_rank = 3 THEN 'TOP PRODUCT' --top2&3 product will also be decribed as top product--
        ELSE 'Other' 
    END AS popularity
FROM ranking
ORDER BY sale_year, sale_month, product_rank;
